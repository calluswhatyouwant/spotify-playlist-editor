## Features

- Create new playlists out of your recent Spotify tracks or your all-time top tracks;
- Sort playlists based on:
    - playlist track attributes (addition date);
    - track attributes (name, length, popularity);
    - album attributes (name, release date);
    - artist attributes (name).

### Current limitations

- It's highly recommended to create a copy of the playlists you want to edit or to use one of the playlist creation options. (play around, but do it safely!);
- You can only sort playlists with 100 tracks or less;
- Sorting might take a while (a playlist with 100 tracks can take between 30 seconds and 1 minute). Do NOT reload or close the playlist page until sorting is over.
